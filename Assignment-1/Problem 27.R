# 27. Vector Multiplication and Element Replacement:
# Use the vector c(3,5,7) and the vector c(2,3) with the rep function and multiplication to produce the vector c(6,15,21,9,15,21).
# How do you then replace the middle four elements with two alternately repeated values of -1 and -150?

vec27 <- rep(c(3,5,7), each = 2) * rep(c(2,3), times = 3)
vec27[c(2:5)] <- c(-1, -150, -1, -150)
