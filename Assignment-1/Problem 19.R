# 19. Vector Repetition and Order Sorting:
# For the vector c(-2, 4, -6, 8, -10), describe how to repeat the vector itself three times and each of its elements 5 times.
# Following this, how would you sort the resulting vector from smallest to largest?

vec19 <- rep(c(-2, 4, -6, 8, -10), times = 3, each = 5)
vec19_sorted <- sort(vec19)
