# 20. Composite Vector Construction:
# Assemble a vector that includes:
# i. A sequence of integers from 15 to 25 (inclusive)
# ii. A twofold repetition of the number 4.2
# iii. The number -5
# iv. A sequence of twelve values starting at 200 and ending at the number which is the total length of the vector created in question 2.
# How would you ensure all components are accurately combined?

vec20 <- c(seq(15, 25), rep(4.2, 2), -5, seq(200, length(vec1), length.out = 12))
